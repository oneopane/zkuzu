### Connection Pool Enhancements

#### Advanced Pool Management
- **Features**:
  - Pool statistics (active/idle/total connections)
  - Connection health checks with configurable intervals
  - Automatic retry on connection failure
  - Connection lifetime management
  - Warm-up and pre-creation options
- **API Additions**:
  ```zig
  Pool.getStats() PoolStats
  Pool.healthCheck() !void
  Pool.setRetryPolicy(policy: RetryPolicy) void
  ```

### Developer Experience

#### API Consistency Improvements
- Add `getDouble()` alias for `getFloat()` for naming consistency with Rust API
- Add explicit `getTimestampTz()` for timezone-aware timestamps
- Standardize method naming conventions across all modules

#### Enhanced Documentation

  - Backpressure handling
  - Progressive result consumption

#### Query Builder API
- **Goal**: Type-safe query construction
- **Example**:
  ```zig
  const query = QueryBuilder.match("Person", .{.name = "Alice"})
      .relationship("KNOWS")
      .to("Person")
      .where(.{.age = .{.gt = 25}})
      .return(&.{"Person.name", "Person.age"})
      .build();
  ```

- Use semantic versioning
- Provide migration guides for breaking changes
- Support at least 2 previous Kuzu versions

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize allocations in hot paths
- Use arena allocators where appropriate
- Profile and optimize based on real workloads
- Consider zero-copy strategies throughout
